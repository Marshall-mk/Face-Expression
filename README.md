# Face-Expression
This repo illustrates the basics of MLOps for computer vision (image classification). It is my attempt to show case the progress I have made so for as an MLOPs learner and practitioner.The project is a toy example of an image classification task. I used keras to build the model, hydra for configuration management, mlflow for model tracking, dagshub for model and data versioning, docker for model packaging etc. The model classifies human facial expression as either sad, angry, fearful, digusted, happy, surprised or neutral. I intend to do this for the various (common) machine learning tasks. i.e Computer vision (image classification, object detection and, image segmentation). Natural language processing (Sentiment analysis, text summarization, translation and, text classification). Time series (forecasting).
